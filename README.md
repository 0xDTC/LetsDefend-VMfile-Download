# Remote File Transfer and RDP Script

This script allows for secure file transfer from a remote Linux server or establishes an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session to a Windows server. Depending on the type of remote server specified, it either performs an RDP session with mapped drive functionality or transfers specified files from a Linux server to a local machine.

## Requirements

- **Linux Environment**: This script is designed to be run from a Linux-based environment.
- **Expect Package**: The script uses the `expect` utility for automating SSH and SCP interactions.
- **xfreerdp**: For connecting to Windows machines via RDP.

To install `expect` and `xfreerdp`:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install expect xfreerdp
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Run the Script
Run the script in a terminal:
```bash
./script.sh
```

### Step 2: Specify the Remote Machine Type
The script prompts whether the remote machine is Windows or Linux:
- **Windows**: Initiates an RDP session to the Windows server with a mapped drive.
- **Linux**: Transfers specified files from the remote Linux server.

### Windows Workflow

1. **Enter Remote Server Details**:
   - IP address
   - Username
   - Password (RDP password for the Windows account)
   - Drive name (e.g., `C:`, `D:`, etc., to map locally)
   - Local directory to map as a drive on the remote server
   
2. **RDP Session**: The script establishes an RDP session using `xfreerdp`, mapping the specified local directory as a drive on the remote Windows server.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Enter the remote server IP address: 192.168.1.10
Enter the remote server username: AdminUser
Enter the RDP password:
Enter the drive name (e.g., 'C:', 'D:'): D:
Enter the local destination directory for the drive (e.g., /home/user/share): /home/kali/letsdefend
```

### Linux Workflow

1. **Enter Remote Server Details**:
   - Username
   - IP address
   - Paths of files on the remote server (multiple paths can be specified separated by spaces)
   - Sudo password for root access on the remote server
   - Destination directory on the local machine

2. **File Transfer**:
   - The script logs in to the Linux server, copies specified files to a temporary location, and sets permissions.
   - Files are transferred to the local destination using SCP, then deleted from the temporary location on the remote server.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Enter the remote server username: user123
Enter the remote server IP address: 192.168.1.20
Enter the paths of the files on the remote server, separated by spaces: /etc/passwd /etc/hosts
Enter the password for sudo access on the remote server:
Enter the destination directory on the local machine (e.g., /home/kali/letsdefend): /home/kali/letsdefend
```

## Output

- **Windows**: Opens an RDP session.
- **Linux**: Copies files to the specified local directory, outputting the success or failure of each transfer.

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient permissions on both the remote and local machines.
- The script uses SSH and SCP for secure file transfers.
- Only use this script in trusted environments due to the handling of passwords in the script.
